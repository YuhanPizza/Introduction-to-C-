# C++ Workshop Readme

Welcome to my C++ Workshops! üñ•Ô∏è

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to provide you with my very own hands-on experience in C++ programming. Workshops I've done when I was just starting my journey looking to expand my skills, with the hope that these topics and procedures will help me build a strong foundation in C++ programming.

## My Journey

My very first experience with programming began six months ago while I was working as a Shipping Supervisor. I embarked on a journey to learn all I could about computer programming. This workshop represents the groundwork that ultimately led me to decide to study programming at Seneca College. The knowledge gained here has been invaluable in shaping my programming skills.
